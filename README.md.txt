# Loan Default Prediction

## Problem Statement:
Banks face losses when borrowers fail to repay loans.
This project predicts whether a customer will default on a loan using machine learning.

## Dataset:
- Source: Kaggle Loan Prediction Dataset
- Records include age, income, loan amount, credit history, etc.

## Approach
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Encoding and Scaling
- Logistic Regression Model

## Model Used
- Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Results
The model can predict loan default with a reasonable accuracy of 91.25%.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future Improvements
- Handle class imbalance (SMOTE)
- Try Random Forest / XGBoost
- Improve feature engineering
